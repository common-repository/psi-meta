Add Meta-Tags to your site, and customize them on a post-by-post basis

== Description ==
We’ve created a WordPress Plugin which adds site-wide Keyword and Description meta-tags. We’re using it on this web site!

The process is simple: define some site-wide description and keyword meta-tags. These will be used everywhere unless you (or your authors) choose to append keywords or override them completely for a particular post or page.

== Installation ==
1. Download the plugin automatically via your WordPress Plugin page, or
1. Download the plugin from the WordPress Plugin Repository (you're probably here, now), then unzip the package and upload the file to your WordPress installation
1. Be sure to activate the Plugin once it's in place
